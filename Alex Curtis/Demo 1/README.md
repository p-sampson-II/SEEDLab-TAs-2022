# Demo 1

### Purpose
There are three main tasks that should be completed for Demo 1. A robot will be created which, using computer vision, can determine the angle between a blue piece of tape and the center axis of the camera. For the second task, the robot will receive a distance to drive forward. It must take these directions and translate them to motion and stop as close as possible to the desired set point. For the final task, the robot will receive both an angle and a distance. It will then rotate to th desired angle and then drive forward the specified distance.

### File Organization
The code for each individual subsystem leading up to the final product will be stored in a unique folder for each subsystem. Finalized versions of this code will be stored in a folder titled "Final Product". Code in other folders represents the individual work of each subsystem leading up to the final integration.
