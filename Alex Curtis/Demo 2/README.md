# Demo 2

### Purpose
In the second demo, the robot find and move to a 3 foot long piece of blue tape. Initially, the robot will not be facing
the tape, so it will have to first search for it. The closest part of the tape will be between 3 and 5 feet away from the
robot, and the tape will be oriented so that it points away from the robotâ€™s initial location. There will be two trials

1. The robot must be able to move to within 1 foot of the tape. If the robot does not start to move
within 30 seconds of the go signal, the trial counts as a failure

2. The robot moves to the tape, follows the tape to the end, and then stops. The
manouver is a success if the tape lies between the robot wheels when the robot stops.

### File Organization
The code for each individual subsystem leading up to the final product will be stored in a unique folder for each subsystem. Finalized versions of this code will be stored in a folder titled "Final Product". Code in other folders represents the individual work of each subsystem leading up to the final integration.
