# Final Demo

### Purpose
The the final demo demonstrates the full implementation of the robot. The robot must be able to keep its rotational
center within 1 foot of the tape at all times. The path to be followed will be approximately as given by the image
below. The spacing of the grid in this image is one foot. The robot will be placed at coordinate (0,0) facing away from
the tape, so it will have to first rotate to locate it. The robotâ€™s success will be determined by how far it is able to make
it down the path, and the speed at which it travels. Note that there is a break in the tape at (5,4). The robot will have
to successfully pass over this break. The robot should stop when it reaches the crossed tape at (7,4).

### File Organization
The code for each individual subsystem leading up to the final product will be stored in a unique folder for each subsystem. Finalized versions of this code will be stored in a folder titled "Final Product". Code in other folders represents the individual work of each subsystem leading up to the final integration.
